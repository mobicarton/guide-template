## Make your own Carton Augemented Reality glasses

Before starting be sure you have all the tools and materials needed.

### Tools
- [ ] Utility knife
- [ ] Scissor
- [ ] Ruler
- [ ] Glue stick

### Materials
- [ ] Printed [template](/template.pdf)
- [ ] 2 pieces of cardboard - 380x260mm and 240x170mm
- [ ] Mirror - 60x60mm
- [ ] Transparent plastic sheet - 105x50mm
- [ ] Sponge
- [ ] Flat stir stick
- [ ] Stretch utility strap
- [ ] Rubber band
- [ ] Adhesive tap

##### Advice
The plastic sheet will be used for the screen. You should avoid to getting one thicker than 0.25mm otherwise the result will be blurred because [Pepper's ghost effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_ghost) appear on each side.

1. Join parts 1 and 2 of your template according to the legend. You should get some like this :
![Alt text](/template_full.png?raw=true "Template Full")
2. Glue the full template onto cardboard
3. Cut out the cardboard following each continuous line (every thin continuous line, even the little ones where you will have to fold)
4. Fold for each arrow (in any order) to the correct side according to the legend
5. Cut the inside part - bold continuous line (this steps after first folding because removing inside part makes the cardboard weaker)
6. Put your rubber band around the cardboard according to the legend for the location
7. Break the flat stir stick to make it 135mm
8. Tap the transparent plastic sheet to the flat stir stick
9. Construct the mirror module
10. Construct the headset by folding again but following the ordered numbers. You should get something similar to this very simplified 3D template :
![Alt text](/template_module.png?raw=true "Template module")

  - Add adhesive **1** and **2** after folding **1**
  - Add adhesive **3** after folding **7**
  - Insert the plastic sheet with the flat stir stick before folding **11**
  - Add adhesive **4** after folding **12**
  ![Alt text](/template_screen.png?raw=true "Template location")

11. Use double sided-adhesive or glue stick to stick the sponge in his location

12. Insert the stretch utility strap

**That's it ! Finish**
